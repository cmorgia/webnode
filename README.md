# Leader/Worker proof-of-concept based on Python

This repository contains a Python-based AWS CDK project ([ref. guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/)), created and maintained using the [Projen](https://projen.io/) tool.

## Usage

For complete reference of Projen commands, please refer to the Projen documentation.

For quick setup, once the repository is locally cloned, execute `npx projen` to setup dependencies and initialize the project.

This is also the command to use to update the dependencies, which are managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) in this project.
